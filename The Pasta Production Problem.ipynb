It takes into account specific scenarios, resources, and knowledge of past and current events. With this insight, your organization can make better decisions and have greater control of business outcomes.  \n\n* Prescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes.  \n\n* Prescriptive analytics takes that insight to the next level by suggesting the optimal way to handle that future situation. Organizations that can act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.  \n<br/>\n\n<u>With prescriptive analytics, you can:</u> \n\n* Automate the complex decisions and trade-offs to better manage your limited resources.\n* Take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk.\n* Proactively update recommendations based on changing events.\n* Meet operational goals, increase customer loyalty, prevent threats and fraud, and optimize business processes."
